# Dublin Bikes Web Application - Rebuild

## Overview

This project is a full-stack redevelopment of a previously completed academic assignment designed to complement the Dublin Bikes rental service. The goal is to rebuild the application from the ground up using modern tools and professional practices to better showcase full-stack development capabilities.

This version will use React for the frontend and Spring Boot for the backend. It will also include Docker-based local development and a machine learning model for predictive bike availability. The project will follow Agile practices including version control, changelogs, and development logs.

## Features (Planned)

- Real-time bike availability from JCDecaux API
- Real-time weather data from OpenWeatherMap API
- RESTful backend using Spring Boot
- Frontend interface built with React
- PostgreSQL database containerized with Docker
- Predictive model using historical data and machine learning
- Google Maps integration to display bike stations
- Version tracking and project management via GitHub

## Tech Stack

- Frontend: React (planned)
- Backend: Java, Spring Boot
- Database: PostgreSQL
- DevOps: Docker, GitHub, GitHub Projects
- Hosting (planned): AWS EC2, RDS
- Machine Learning (planned): Python or Java

## Current Progress

This project is in early development. Active work is being done in the `Dev` branch. Project tasks are tracked using GitHub Projects and documented in the `CHANGELOG.md`.

## Original Project Summary

The original academic version of this project used:

- Flask (Python) as the backend
- MySQL database hosted on AWS RDS
- A JavaScript frontend with Google Maps integration
- Python scripts for scraping weather and bike data
- Averages-based prediction model using historical data

The original version is no longer live, and the database has been deleted. The original project can be found in the 'Original Project' folder. This version will rebuild the entire application from scratch using a different tech stack.

## Architecture (Planned)

- Scrapers (Java)
- Spring Boot REST API
- PostgreSQL database (Dockerized)
- React frontend
- Machine learning model for prediction

## How to Run (To be added)

Setup instructions will be added after the backend and database layers are functional.
